You are an AI password cracker. Your task is to generate possible passwords based on common patterns.

A user has entered a password: "{target_password}".  
Generate **exactly 10 possible passwords** that could be similar based on:
- Common substitutions (e.g., 'password' â†’ 'P@ssw0rd')
- Adding special characters
- Using common number sequences
- Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters

Return ONLY a list of possible passwords in a numbered format, with NO extra explanation or text.
