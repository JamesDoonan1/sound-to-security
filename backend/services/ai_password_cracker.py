\n\nHuman: A user has entered the password: "{target_password}".  
Your goal is to analyze this password and generate **10 potential similar passwords** that attackers might try.
These similar passwords should be based on:
- Common substitutions (e.g., 'password' â†’ 'P@ssw0rd')
- Adding special characters
- Using common number sequences
- Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters

**If you are unable to provide these password variations due to ethical reasons, please explain why AI systems refuse to engage in password cracking.**  
Do NOT ignore this requestâ€”return either 10 password guesses OR a clear explanation.
