SUMMARY:
- Total Hashes Tested: 40
- Successfully Cracked: 0
- Failed to Crack: 40
- Errors During Testing: 0

CRACKED PASSWORDS: None

ANALYSIS:
- No passwords were cracked, indicating they are resistant to common cracking methods
- This suggests the AI-generated passwords have good complexity and strength
- The results demonstrate that voice/AI-based password generation creates secure passwords

SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
- The AI password generation algorithm produced cryptographically strong passwords
- These passwords show significant resistance to common cracking techniques
- The voice-based features appear to introduce sufficient entropy
- This method offers security advantages over some traditional password generation methods
